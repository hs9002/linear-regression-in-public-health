# Linear regression in public health
## Imperial College London

Public Health has been defined as “the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society”. Knowing what causes disease and what makes it worse are clearly vital parts of this. 
This requires the development of statistical models that describe how patient and environmental factors affect our chances of getting ill. 
This course shows you how to create such models from scratch, beginning with introducing you to the concept of correlation and  linear regression before walking you through importing and examining your data, and then showing you how to fit models. 
Using the example of respiratory disease, these models will describe how patient and other factors affect outcomes such as lung function.
